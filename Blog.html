<div class="blog">
  <p>This month, I have completed a new piece, that I have titled "Fields."</p><br>
  <img class="blogpic" src="Websiteimage/Fields.jpg" alt="Fields"><br>
  <p>Besides the challenge of getting the portrait as accurate as possible,
    the biggest challenge in this piece, by far, was the sweater. It was all too easy to
    get lost in the pattern and forget about the form of the sweater itself.
    Once I realized why I was struggling so much (which probably should have been obvious, really!)
    I went back and re-established the folds of the sweater and then painted the stripes on top.<br>
    I like to spend my time in between larger pieces doing small studies. It keeps me sharp,
    keeps me painting and they're genuinely fun to work on. Here is a very seasonal small study:</p><br>

    <p>On another note, I am very excited that my paintings "It's Not What We Remember" and "Embrace"
      have both been on display in the 37th Elkhart Juried Regional show at the Midwest Museum of American Art.
      On November 12, I will be giving a talk about my work, focusing on my process and the two pieces
      that are in the show. I'm very excited!</p>
