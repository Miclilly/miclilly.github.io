  <p>My work primarily focuses on the relationships between people and their
    environments, exploring how our surroundings shape our experiences and
    state of mind. Narrative is an important element in my paintings,
    as well as themes of isolation, transitions and exploring oneâ€™s self. Taking from my
    experiences growing up in northwest Indiana, investigating the surroundings
    of the Midwest is a common element in many of my works. <br>
    <br>
    A strong commitment to realism is at the core of my paintings.
    Taking inspiration from the work of the Italian Renaissance
    masters, as well as many contemporary artists working today,
    I strive to create as accurate of a representation of my subject as possible,
    using classical oil painting techniques. Juxtaposing the
    figure with a landscape of my choosing creates an element of narrative and
    mystery in the paintings.
